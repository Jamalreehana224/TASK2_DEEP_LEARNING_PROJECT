#TASK_2DEEP LEARNING PROJECT

*COMPANY : Codtech It Solutions*

*NAME : SHAIK JAMAL REEHANA*

*DOMAIN : DATA SCIENCE*

*DURATION : 8 WEEKS*

*MENTOR :NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR*

**DESCRIPTION OF TASK WHAT I HAVE DOEN :

This project involves implementing a deep learning model for either image classification or natural language processing using TensorFlow or PyTorch. The goal is to develop a functional and accurate neural network capable of understanding patterns in data and making predictions.

In this implementation, an image classification model is built using TensorFlow and trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model uses a neural network architecture to recognize and classify various clothing items like shirts, shoes, trousers, etc. The task also includes visualizing prediction results to interpret the model's performance.**
